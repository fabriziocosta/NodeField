# Preferences

## Notebooks

- Keep notebooks lean before commits (clear outputs and reduce execution noise).
- Prefer notebook cells that call functions from `.py` modules instead of embedding long logic inline.
- Use utility-style modules for reusable notebook logic, including specialized helpers in `notebooks/` when useful.
- Keep notebook execution cells focused on variable assignments and function calls.
- Add concise comments in notebook cells to clarify variable meaning and role in the workflow.

## Python Modules

- Public-facing functions in `.py` files should use Google-style docstrings.
- Include `Args:` with parameter descriptions.
- Include `Returns:` with return-value descriptions.
