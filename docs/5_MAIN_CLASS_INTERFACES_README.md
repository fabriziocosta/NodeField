# Main Class Interfaces

This document is the explicit API reference for the main public classes in the Conditional Node Field graph-generation stack.

It complements the architecture documents:

- [`2_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_README.md`](2_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_README.md)
- [`1_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_GRAPH_GENERATOR_README.md`](1_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_GRAPH_GENERATOR_README.md)
- [`3_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_GRAPH_DECODER_README.md`](3_CONDITIONAL_NODE_FIELD_GRAPH_DECODER_README.md)
- [`4_TARGET_GUIDANCE_README.md`](4_TARGET_GUIDANCE_README.md)

The goal here is practical:

- show the main public interfaces in one place,
- explain what each parameter means,
- explain what usually happens when you increase or decrease that parameter.

## Scope

The main public classes are:

- `GraphConditioningBatch`
- `NodeGenerationBatch`
- `GeneratedNodeBatch`
- `ConditionalNodeFieldGenerator`
- `ConditionalNodeFieldGraphDecoder`
- `ConditionalNodeFieldGraphGenerator`

This document focuses on public constructors and public workflow methods. Internal helper methods are intentionally omitted.

## Batch Containers

These dataclasses are the explicit data contracts between the orchestration layer, the node generator, and the graph decoder.

### `GraphConditioningBatch`

Used for node generation and graph decoding.

```python
GraphConditioningBatch(
    graph_embeddings: np.ndarray,
    node_counts: np.ndarray,
    edge_counts: np.ndarray,
)
```

Parameters:

- `graph_embeddings`
  Graph-level conditioning embeddings, usually shape `(B, G)` where `B` is batch size.
  Increase embedding dimension: more capacity to encode graph context, but also more model capacity and more risk of overfitting.
  Decrease embedding dimension: simpler conditioning, lower memory, but less descriptive graph context.

- `node_counts`
  Integer node-count targets per graph, usually shape `(B,)`.
  Larger values request larger decoded graphs.
  Smaller values request smaller decoded graphs.

- `edge_counts`
  Integer edge-count targets per graph, usually shape `(B,)`.
  Larger values bias generation toward denser graphs.
  Smaller values bias generation toward sparser graphs.

### `NodeGenerationBatch`

Used for training `ConditionalNodeFieldGenerator`.

```python
NodeGenerationBatch(
    node_embeddings_list: List[np.ndarray],
    node_presence_mask: np.ndarray,
    node_degree_targets: np.ndarray,
    node_label_targets: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,
    edge_pairs: Optional[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]] = None,
    edge_targets: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    edge_label_pairs: Optional[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]] = None,
    edge_label_targets: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    auxiliary_edge_pairs: Optional[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]] = None,
    auxiliary_edge_targets: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
)
```

Parameters:

- `node_embeddings_list`
  Per-graph node-feature matrices before padding.
  Higher feature dimension can carry richer node information but increases model size and training difficulty.
  Lower feature dimension is easier to fit but may lose structural or semantic information.

- `node_presence_mask`
  Boolean mask of active node slots after padding, usually shape `(B, N)`.
  More `True` entries correspond to larger effective graphs.
  More `False` entries correspond to more padding and less active structure.

- `node_degree_targets`
  Integer degree targets per node slot, usually shape `(B, N)`.
  Higher degree targets encourage denser local connectivity.
  Lower degree targets encourage sparser local connectivity.

- `node_label_targets`
  Optional categorical node labels for learned node-label prediction.
  More label diversity makes the task richer but harder.
  Less label diversity can make the label head trivial or unnecessary.

- `edge_pairs`
  Optional `(graph_index, i, j)` training pairs for direct edge supervision.
  More pairs give stronger edge supervision but increase training cost.
  Fewer pairs reduce cost but weaken edge-learning signals.

- `edge_targets`
  Optional binary labels aligned with `edge_pairs`.
  More positive edges strengthen direct adjacency learning.
  More negatives push the model toward conservative edge prediction.

- `edge_label_pairs`
  Optional `(graph_index, i, j)` pairs for edge-label supervision.
  More pairs give stronger edge-label learning signal.
  Fewer pairs reduce supervision strength.

- `edge_label_targets`
  Optional categorical edge labels aligned with `edge_label_pairs`.
  More label classes increase semantic coverage but also difficulty.
  Fewer classes simplify the task.

- `auxiliary_edge_pairs`
  Optional extra supervision pairs, typically for longer-horizon locality.
  More auxiliary pairs can stabilize structural learning.
  Too many can distract from the main direct-edge objective.

- `auxiliary_edge_targets`
  Optional labels aligned with `auxiliary_edge_pairs`.
  Higher positive rate tends to encourage broader connectivity.
  Lower positive rate tends to encourage stricter locality.

### `GeneratedNodeBatch`

Returned by `ConditionalNodeFieldGenerator.predict*`.

```python
GeneratedNodeBatch(
    node_presence_mask: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    node_degree_predictions: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    node_labels: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,
    edge_probability_matrices: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,
    edge_label_matrices: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,
)
```

Fields:

- `node_presence_mask`
  Predicted active node slots.
  More `True` entries mean larger generated graphs.
  Fewer `True` entries mean smaller generated graphs.

- `node_degree_predictions`
  Predicted per-node degree classes or values.
  Larger predicted degrees usually produce denser decoded graphs.
  Smaller predicted degrees usually produce sparser decoded graphs.

- `node_labels`
  Optional predicted node labels.

- `edge_probability_matrices`
  Optional dense per-graph edge-probability matrices.
  Higher probabilities give the decoder more confidence in including edges.
  Lower probabilities make the decoder rely more on constraint tradeoffs.

- `edge_label_matrices`
  Optional dense per-graph edge-label predictions.

## `ConditionalNodeFieldGenerator`

This is the node-level generator. It learns to map graph-level conditions to node-level structural and semantic outputs.

Primary implementation:

  Increase: stronger pressure against false-positive edges, often sparser predictions.
  Decrease: weaker negative pressure, often denser predictions.

- `locality_sampling_strategy`

  Optional target values used to train CFG-ready target-conditioning in the node generator.
  Provide targets: enables CFG support in the fitted generator only if `cfg_target_mode` was configured explicitly
  on the node generator.
  Omit targets: no CFG target-conditioning path is trained.

- `ckpt_path`
  Optional checkpoint path forwarded to the underlying node generator fit call.
  Provide a checkpoint path: resumes node-generator training from that checkpoint.
  Omit it: trains from scratch.

#### `encode(...)`

```python
encode(
    graphs: List[nx.Graph],
) -> Tuple[List[np.ndarray], GraphConditioningBatch]
```

Returns:

- list of per-graph node embedding matrices,
- a `GraphConditioningBatch` with graph embeddings, node counts, and edge counts.

#### `set_guidance_predictor(...)`

```python
set_guidance_predictor(
    mode: str,
    output_dimension: Optional[int] = None,
    hidden_dimension: Optional[int] = None,
) -> None
```

Thin orchestration wrapper around the node-generator method of the same name.

#### `set_guidance_classifier(...)`

```python
set_guidance_classifier(
    num_classes: int,
    hidden_dimension: Optional[int] = None,
) -> None
```

Thin orchestration wrapper around the node-generator classifier setup.

#### `train_guidance_predictor(...)`

```python
train_guidance_predictor(
    graphs: List[nx.Graph],
    targets: Sequence[Any],
    mode: Optional[str] = None,
    learning_rate: float = 1e-3,
    maximum_epochs: int = 30,
    batch_size: Optional[int] = None,
    noise_scale: Optional[float] = None,
) -> None
```

Same tuning logic as the node-generator variant, but this method starts from raw graphs and internally builds the required batches.

    noise_scale: Optional[float] = None,
) -> None
```

## Recommended Mental Model

Use these three levels:

1. `ConditionalNodeFieldGraphGenerator`
   The main end-to-end interface for most users.

2. `ConditionalNodeFieldGenerator`
   The lower-level node generator when you want direct control over batches and node-level outputs.

3. `ConditionalNodeFieldGraphDecoder`
   The reconstruction layer when you want to decode node outputs manually or study decode constraints separately.

## Tuning Shortcuts

If outputs are too small:

- decrease `existence_threshold`,
- decrease `negative_sample_factor`,
- increase `lambda_node_exist_importance`,
- increase `lambda_node_count_importance`.

If outputs are too dense:

- increase `negative_sample_factor`,
- decrease `edge_counts` in conditioning,
- decrease `lambda_direct_edge_importance` only if edge probabilities are overconfident and noisy.

If CFG is too weak:

- increase `guidance_scale`,
- decrease `cfg_condition_dropout_prob` only if conditional specialization is too weak,
- make sure `targets` were actually passed during `fit(...)`.

If post-hoc guidance is too weak:

- increase `classifier_scale` or `predictor_scale`,
- increase separate predictor capacity with `hidden_dimension`,
- train the guidance predictor longer,
- use a moderate `noise_scale` during predictor training so gradients remain useful on sampled states.

If sampling is unstable:

- decrease `sampling_step_size`,
- decrease `guidance_scale` or predictor guidance scale,
- decrease `langevin_noise_scale`,
- increase `sampling_steps`.
